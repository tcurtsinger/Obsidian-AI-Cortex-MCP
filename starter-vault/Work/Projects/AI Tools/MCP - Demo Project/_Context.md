# MCP - Demo Project

> Minimal demo project for validating deterministic session workflows.

## Goal

Validate start/checkpoint/tracker-sync/resume behavior end-to-end.

## Current Status

- Demo context initialized.
- Tracker configured and linked.
- Starter session log created.

## Current Priorities

1. Run start macro and confirm project summary is correct.
2. Run checkpoint macro and confirm session log append works.
3. Run resume macro and confirm deterministic recovery works.

## Known Risks/Blockers

- None hard.
- Risk: stale active project pointer can route startup incorrectly.

## Next 3 Actions

1. Run `Run start macro now.`
2. Run `Run checkpoint macro now.`
3. Run `Run resume macro now.`
